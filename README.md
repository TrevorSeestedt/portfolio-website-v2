# Portfolio Website v2.0

A modern, interactive portfolio website built with React and Vite, featuring a dynamic music library component that integrates with Spotify.

## ðŸ”’ SECURITY NOTICE

**IMPORTANT**: This project handles sensitive Spotify API tokens. Please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Never commit token files** - The `backend/owner_token.json` file contains sensitive refresh tokens
2. **Use environment variables** - Store sensitive data in `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`)
3. **Revoke exposed tokens** - If tokens are accidentally exposed, immediately revoke access at [Spotify Account Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/)
4. **Regular token rotation** - Periodically refresh your Spotify app credentials

## Features

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React

## Prerequisites

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]

```

2. Install dependencies:

VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

4. **IMPORTANT**: Set up token file (after first authentication):
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp backend/owner_token.example.json backend/owner_token.json
# The actual token will be populated after first Spotify login
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Spotify Integration

1. A Spotify Developer account
2. A registered Spotify application
3. Proper CORS configuration on your backend

### Token Security
- Tokens are automatically saved after first authentication
- Refresh tokens are stored locally in `backend/owner_token.json` (gitignored)
